Thank you for clarifying that you're using VirtualBox instead of Docker. If your DHCP server container (running inside a VM on VirtualBox) doesn't have an IP address, it could be due to several factors related to the network configuration within VirtualBox and the container's configuration. Here's how to troubleshoot and fix the issue in the VirtualBox environment.

Step-by-Step Troubleshooting and Configuration
1. Ensure Correct Network Adapter Settings in VirtualBox
For a container inside a VM (let’s assume the VM is running a Linux-based system), you need to ensure that the VM is connected to the right network mode. This will allow the container to access the network and get an IP address from a DHCP server.

Network Mode Options in VirtualBox:
Bridged Adapter: The VM will act as if it's another physical machine on your network, receiving an IP from your network's DHCP server.
NAT (Network Address Translation): The VM will get an internal IP and communicate with the outside world via the host machine's network connection (typically the IP is assigned in the 10.0.2.x range).
Internal Network: The VM is isolated from both the host and the outside network but can communicate with other VMs in the same internal network.
Host-Only Adapter: The VM can communicate with the host machine but not with the outside world (internet).
Solution: Use Internal Network for Container-to-Container Communication (and DHCP Server)
Since you're running a DHCP server container inside a VM, Internal Network mode in VirtualBox is likely your best bet, as it isolates the VM from the outside world but allows it to manage its own internal IP assignments.

In VirtualBox:
Shut down your VM.
Go to Settings of the VM in VirtualBox.
Under the Network tab:
Set Adapter 1 to Internal Network.
Give the internal network a name, such as int-net.
Click OK to save the settings.
For Containers (within the VM):
If the DHCP server is inside a container, ensure the container is configured to use the correct network interface within the VM. The container should be configured to use a virtual Ethernet interface that connects to the Internal Network.

2. Check IP Address in the Container
Ensure that the container inside your VM (the DHCP server container) is configured to obtain or assign an IP address correctly.

Check the container’s network interface: You can run this inside the container to check its interfaces:

bash
Copy
ip a
If the container is running but doesn't have an IP address, it's possible that it doesn't have access to the internal network.

Network Configuration for Container:

Ensure the container is connected to the internal network of the VM.
Make sure the container's DHCP service is configured to listen to the correct interface.
3. Check if the DHCP Server is Running
Make sure the DHCP server inside the container is running and configured correctly.

Verify DHCP server status inside the container:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
If it's not running, start it:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server
Verify Configuration:

Open /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf in your container.
Ensure it's configured correctly for the internal network. For example:
bash
Copy
subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 10.0.0.100 10.0.0.200;   # Assign IPs to containers/VMs in this range
    option routers 10.0.0.1;       # The gateway IP in the internal network
    option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;  # DNS servers
}
Restart DHCP Server: After making any changes, restart the DHCP service:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
4. Verify Container Configuration for DHCP
If you're using a Docker container (inside your VM), make sure the container is set to use the correct network mode (bridge, host, or internal). For an Internal Network, Docker's default bridge network should be sufficient, but make sure it’s running in the correct mode.

You can check this using docker inspect:

bash
Copy
docker inspect <container_name_or_id>
Look for the Networks section to ensure it is attached to the internal network (or use docker network ls to verify that the correct network is being used).

5. Check VirtualBox Network Settings for Other VMs/Containers
If you have other VMs or containers that are supposed to be receiving IPs from the DHCP server, make sure:

They are also connected to the same internal network (int-net or whatever network name you use).
They are set to use DHCP to automatically receive IPs.
For example, on Fedora-based VMs/containers, check the following network configuration in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:

bash
Copy
DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
Then, restart the network service:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl restart network
6. Check VirtualBox Logs
If you're still facing issues, check the VirtualBox logs for any networking-related issues:

Open VirtualBox Manager.
Select your VM and click Show Log.
Look for any warnings or errors related to the network adapter or DHCP.
7. Verify Firewall and Security Settings
Ensure that your VM and container firewall settings are not blocking the DHCP traffic. You might need to temporarily disable the firewall for testing:

Disable firewall (on the VM) temporarily:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
On the container (if applicable), disable any internal firewall:

bash
Copy
sudo ufw disable
Conclusion
If your DHCP server container doesn't have an IP address, it’s likely due to network configuration issues in VirtualBox, incorrect DHCP server settings, or improper container networking. By following the steps above, ensuring the correct network mode, verifying the DHCP server configuration, and ensuring the firewall isn't blocking traffic, you should be able to resolve the issue and have the DHCP server assign IP addresses to other containers/VMs within the internal network.
